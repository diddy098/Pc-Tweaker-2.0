If you run it through Virustotal it comes out as a Trojan that shit is not true. 
It's because it's going into your reg files and it also goes through your system files
and overall goes through important files that Windows needs to run. for the "fpsboost" file virus total says it's a "BehavesLike.Trojan.zq" and "BAT/CleanLog.A Potentially Unsafe" 
Like I said it also goes through your system files and overall goes through essential files. Read the code if you don't believe me.

1) Make a system restore point. There is a file called "Restore Point"

2) Open "TempFileDeleter" this just deletes all the corrupted files on your computer.

3) Open "fpsboost" this changes REG files.

4) Open "Optimize" also changes REG files.

Enjoy this shit
