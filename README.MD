If you run it through Virustotal it comes out as a Trojan that shit is not true. 
It's because it's going into your reg files and it also goes through your system files
and overall goes through important files that Windows needs to run. 
Like I said it also goes through your system files and overall goes through essential files. Read the code if you don't believe me.


Enjoy this shit 

LOVE YALL <3
