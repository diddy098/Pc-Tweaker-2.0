If you run it through Virustotal it comes out as a Trojan that shit is not true. 
It's because it's going into your reg files and it also goes through your system files
and overall goes through important files that Windows needs to run. 
Like I said, it also goes through your system files and essential files. Read the code if you don't believe me.

But anyway, to download it, disable Windows Defender. If you have Chrome and it says "virus detected," do Ctrl+J, then click the three dots, and then allow download.
Then you have the files.


Enjoy this shit
